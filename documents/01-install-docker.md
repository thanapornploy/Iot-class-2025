# Debian 12 Docker installation

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/


# 1. Uninstall old versions

Before you can install Docker Engine, you need to uninstall any conflicting packages.

Run the following command to uninstall all conflicting packages:


```bash
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```

# 2. Install using the apt repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker apt repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

Set up Docker's apt repository.

```bash
#  Add Docker's official GPG key:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

#  Add the repository to Apt sources:

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

# 3. Install the Docker packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

# Linux post-installation steps for Docker Engine

These optional post-installation procedures describe how to configure your Linux host machine to work better with Docker.

## Manage Docker as a non-root user

The Docker daemon binds to a Unix socket, not a TCP port. By default it's the root user that owns the Unix socket, and other users can only access it using sudo. The Docker daemon always runs as the root user.

If you don't want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager. In that case, there is no need for you to manually create the group.

To create the docker group and add your user:

## 1. Create the docker group.


```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

## 2. Add your user to the docker group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
## 3. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

If you're running Linux in a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.
You can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:


```bash
newgrp docker
```


# Configure Docker to start on boot with systemd

Many modern Linux distributions use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. On Debian and Ubuntu, the Docker service starts on boot by default. To automatically start Docker and containerd on boot for other Linux distributions using systemd, run the following commands:


```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
```
